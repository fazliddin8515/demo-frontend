# demo-frontend

A very simple frontend project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The main goal of this project is **learning and practicing** new concepts related to development and deployment.

## 🛠️ What This Project Is About

This project was created to practice:

- CI/CD with **GitHub Actions** and **Watchtower**
- **Dockerizing** a frontend application
- Using **Docker Compose** for multi-container setups
- Serving static files with **NGINX**
- Deploying to an **Ubuntu server**
- Integrating with a backend
- General workflow of building → containerizing → deploying apps

> **Note:** The website itself is intentionally minimal and has no real functionality — the focus is on the **deployment and infrastructure process**, not the UI.
